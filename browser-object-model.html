<p>The setInterval() method allows code to be executed at a specified time interval. The specified code will continue executing at the given interval until the method clearInterval() is called.</p>

<p>The setTimeout() method allows code to be executed after specified time interval has passed. The specified code will only be executed once. The timeout code execution can be cancelled via the clearTimeout() method.</p>

<p>The location object is a very useful feature of the BOM. It is accessible though both the window object, and also the document object which will be discussed in the lessons on the Document Object Model.

    The location object is aware of the currently loaded document and provides detailed url information. The location object can also be used to redirect the browser to a new location. </p>
