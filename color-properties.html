<h2>1.How does hexadecimal color coding work?</h2>
<div class="color-container">
<div class="color-panel cool-blue">
    <p class="color-label">Blue</p>
    <p class="color-hex">#2d5dcc</p>

</div>
</div>


<h2>2.Why use CSS color names over hex values and vice versa?</h2>
<p> Different browsers may not agree on the names of colors.
    The main advantage of a Hexadecimal Number is that it is very compact and by using a base of 16 means that the number of digits used to represent a given number is usually less than in binary or decimal. Also, it is quick and easy to convert between hexadecimal numbers and binary.</p>

<h2>3. Why use rgb to define a CSS color vs. a hex value?</h2>
<p>RGB is specific to digital applications and is the most common color profile used by tv, computer monitors and mobile devices.
    RGB uses an additive process which is the opposite of CMYK. This results in a larger range of colors than printed colors.</p>



<h2>4. What is the difference between 3 digit hex values and 6? </h2>
<p>3 digit hex values are a simplified version of 6 digit hex values. Not all 6 digit hex values can be converted into a 3 digit. An example of what can be converted is when duplicate characters are present:
    #FFCC00 => #FC0</p>

<h2>5.'background' and 'background-color' properties can produce the same output; why is this possible? </h2>



<h2>6. What is the 'a' in rgba? </h2>
<p> Alpha is used to adjust transparency. The alpha is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 ( fully opaque)</p>
<div class="aquestion" id="ten">
    <p class= "pAQ">10%</p>
</div>
<div class="aquestion" id="fifty">
    <p class="pAQ">50%</p>
</div>

<div class="aquestion" id="hundred">
    <p class="pAQ">100%</p>
</div>

<h2> 7.What is the 'Digital Color Meter' on a Mac? How is the helpful? </h2>

<h2> 8.What are CSS gradients?</h2>
